<h2>What is Plagiarism?</h2>
	
<p>Plagiarism is the act of  a person presenting another author's language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions as their own work, without full acknowledgement. According to the Merriam-Webster online dictionary, to "plagiarize" means:</p>

 <ul>

<li>to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own</li>
<li>to use (another's production) without crediting the source</li>
<li>to commit literary theft</li>
<li>to present as new and original an idea or product derived from an existing source</li>


  </ul> 
  
  
<p>This can be done unintentionally or intentionally. Even though is plagiarism ins't a criminal offense, it is illegal if it violates an author's intellectual property rights.</p>
