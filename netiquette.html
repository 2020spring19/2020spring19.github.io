<h1>Netiquette for Teenagers on Social Media</h1>
	
<div class="rules">
<h3>Always remember these rules when posting on social media:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>If you wouldn’t say it to someone’s face, don’t post it online.</li>
		<li>If you wouldn’t show it in public, don’t post it online.</li>
	</ul>

<h2 id="heading1">Don't Post False Information</h2>
<p>Make sure that the information you post on social media is correct and authentic. Information you hear from your friends or from someone else on social media may not always be correct, so always check your facts. Email someone who will know if something is correct, or look it up on Google using a trustworthy source. If you see false information on social media, message the person who published the information, and ask them to take it down. If this doesn’t work, consider reporting their account. Always be 100% sure that the information is false before reporting!
</p>
<h2 id="heading2">Respect Other People's Privacy</h2>
<p>Make sure you respect other people's privacy when using social media. You may not realize this, but you are partly responsible for the privacy of others while using social media. This means that you should never post a photo of someone else without their permission. You also should never post information that someone wouldn’t want you to post. When you are about to post something about someone else, you have to think <span>"would I want someone to post this information about me?"</span> Also remember to never use social media as a way of revenge. It is very unhealthy, and also very illegal.</p>
<h2 id="heading3">Always Check and Respond to Messages</h2>
<p>Always check and respond to messages on social media. Don’t wait for days to respond to someone’s message. It could be very important and needing an answer immediately. Even if you don’t know the answer to a question that someone is asking you, don’t ignore them. Attempt to point them in the right direction, or tell them someone who would know the answer. This doesn’t mean respond to ALL messages though. Make sure to always delete spam and unsolicited messages. They could be a danger to your privacy.
