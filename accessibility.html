<h2>What is Web Accessibility?</h2>
	
<p>Web Accessibility refers to the accessibility of a computer system to all people, regardless of disability type or severity of impairment. It helps these people with disabilities perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web. Web accessibility can also benefit those with temporary or conditional disabilities like slow internet connection, broken arm, e.t.c. Web Accessibility is important because it helps provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with disabilities, and to help them participate more actively in society.</p>

<h2>What is a Screen Reader?</h2>	

<p>A screen reader is a software application that enables people with severe visual impairments to use a computer. Screen readers work closely with the computer’s Operating System to provide information about icons, menus, dialogue boxes, files and folders. The device provides access to the entire OS that it works with, including many common applications.
</p>	
	
<p>There are two ways that a screen reader relays information to the user:</p>	
	
<ul>
	<li>Speech</li>
	<li>Brail</li>
</ul>	
	
<p>Since the majority of users don’t use a mouse, all screen readers use a wide variety of keyboard commands to carry out different tasks. Tasks include reading part or whole of a document, navigating web pages, opening and closing files, editing and listening to music. A visually impaired computer user will use a combination of screen reader commands and operating system commands to accomplish the many tasks a computer is capable of performing.
</p>

<h2>Why are Screen Readers Important?</h2>
	
<p>Screen readers are important because they are considered the "litmus tests" in the development of accessible user interfaces. If a website can be read and operated by a screen reader, it can be considered pretty accessible. Screen reader compliant websites comply with a lot of requirements that are not only important to blind people, but also to many other groups of people with special needs.
