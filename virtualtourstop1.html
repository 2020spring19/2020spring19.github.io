<p>You have reached the first stop of your virtual tour! Read below to learn about the first of the five layers of the ocean, the epipelagic zone.</p>
<br>
<p>The surface layer of the ocean is known as the epipelagic zone. It extends from the surface to 656 feet. It is also known as the sunlight zone because it is where most of the visible light exists. With the light comes heat, and this heat is responsible for the wide range of temperatures that occur in this zone. Temperatures in this layer can reach as high as 97º Fahrenheit in the Persian Gulf. Near the poles, it can get as cold as 28º Fahrenheit. There are thousands of animals that roam this zone, including dolphins, most sharks, jellyfish, tuna and corals. Seaweed is a common plant in the epipelagic zone, along with various algae and phytoplankton.
